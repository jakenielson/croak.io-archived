# croak.io

> My website. Created with Nuxt, Storyblok, and love to host my games.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn run build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

## To Do

* The mounted and beforeDestroy logic that adds and removes style should instead add and remove a class
* Rename and rethink bloks with additional configuration (I understand these better now)
* Add gameboy game background
* Fix layout and loading on mobile

* Game should be full screen and have an in-game back button

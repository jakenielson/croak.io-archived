## FOR FUTURE PROJECTS

* For game objects, find common things that can be repeated, and make a parent class that includes all that shit
  - For example, I copy-pasted functions from Cars to LilyPads. Any time you copy-paste, think about this.
* Everything I marked as "this is awkward" came back to bite me in the ass. Trust your instincts. Use the force.

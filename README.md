# Bugs
* Layout of game pages is not 1:1 on mobile
* On mobile, the game container is 100% the width of the screen
* On mobile, the .game section is not visible. its child likely takes its full width
* on mobile, the .game section and the game container are not 100% the height of the main, but the main is the right height
* I suspect this has something to do with mobile not interpreting my calc(percentage) properly
* But that doesn't explain why the .game section isn't the right height
